# Speech Macros Command Set

The Speech Macros Command Set is an XML set that defines Speech Macros files.


## ```<speechMacros>```
The ```<speechMacros>``` element is the outermost XML element and it initializes a Speech Macro file.  
 
The following example shows how to initialize a Speech Macro using the ```<speechMacros>``` element:
```xml
<speechMacros>
  <command>
    <listenFor>My Address</listenFor>
    <insertText>One Microsoft Way Redmond WA</insertText>
  </command>
</speechMacros>
```

```<command>```
The ```<command>``` element is the container that holds conditions, rule generators and executors.

One or more ```<command>``` elements

The ```<speechMacros>``` element must contain one or more ```<command>``` elements.  
 
The following example contains two ```<command>``` tags:
```xml
<speechMacros>
  <command>
    <listenFor>My Work Address</listenFor>
    <insertText>One Microsoft Way Redmond WA</insertText>
  </command>
  <command>
    <listenFor>My Home Address</listenFor>
    <insertText>Seattle WA</insertText>
  </command>
</speechMacros>
```

## Conditions
Conditions specify when a particular rule should be recognized.  
When a condition is true then the computer should listen for the command phrases specified by the rule generators.  
When a condition is false then the computer should disable the command phrases specified by rule generators.

### Zero Conditions

If there are zero conditions the command is enabled at all times.

### One Condition

If a command has one condition, that condition must be satisfied for the command to be enabled.

### More than one Condition

If a command has more than one conditions, all of the conditions must be satisfied for the command to be enabled.

### Global Conditions

Conditions are normally contained inside ```<command>```. However if the same condition will be used in different ```<command>``` commands set, the condition can be a child of ```<speechMacros>``` and is then considered a global condition.

### List of Conditions

- appIsInForeground
- appIsRunning
- stateIsSet
- condition
- scriptCondition

**```<appIsInForeground>```**

The ```<appIsInForeground>``` condition checks if a specific application is the foreground window. If the application is the foreground window the condition holds true otherwise the condition is false. 
 
Optional attributes of ```<appIsInForeground>```. However at least one must be specified.  
- ```processName```
- ```WindowTitle```
- ```WindowTitleContains```

 
```processName```. (optional) 
The pocessName attribute of the ```<appIsInForeground>``` condition specifies the process name of the application that is being checked.  
 
The following example checks if NOTEPAD.EXE is the foreground window:
```xml
<appIsInForeground processName = "NOTEPAD.EXE" />
```
 
```windowTitleContains```. (optional) 
The windowTitleContains attribute of the ```<appIsInForeground>``` condition specifies a substring of text in the window title of the application that is being checked. 
 
The following example checks if the window title of the foreground application contains the substring "Notepad":
```xml
<appIsInForeground windowTitleContains = "Notepad" />
```
 
```windowTitle```. (optional) 
The windowTitle attribute of the ```<appIsInForeground>``` condition specifies the exact text of the window title of the application that is being checked.  
 
The following example checks if "NOTEPAD.EXE" is the foreground window and that it has a dialog box with the exact title "Font":
```xml
<appIsInForeground processName = "NOTEPAD.EXE" windowTitle="Font" />
```

**```<appIsRunning>```**

The ```<appIsRunning>``` condition checks if a specific application is running. 
If the application is running the condition holds true, otherwise the condition is false. 
 
â€¢ Attributes: 
Note: processName, WindowTitle or WindowTitleContains are optional attributes of ```<appIsRunning>```. However at least one must be specified.  
 
```processName```. (optional) 
The pocessName attribute of the ```<appIsRunning>``` condition specifies the process' name of the application that is being checked.  
 
The following example checks if NOTEPAD.EXE is running:
```xml
<appIsRunning processName = "NOTEPAD.EXE" />
```
 
```windowTitleContains```. (optional) 
The windowTitleContains attribute of the ```<appIsRunning>``` condition specifies a substring of text in the window title of the application that is being checked. 
 
The following example checks if the title of an application running contains the substring Notepad:
```xml
<appIsRunning windowTitleContains = "Notepad" />
```
 
```windowTitle```. (optional) 
The windowTitle attribute of the ```<appIsRunning>``` condition specifies the exact text of the window title of the application that is being checked.  
 
The following example checks if a Notepad window with the title "test - Notepad" is running:
```xml
<appIsRunning processName = "NOTEPAD.EXE" windowTitle="test - Notepad" />
```

**```<stateIsSet>```**
 
The ```<stateIsSet>``` condition checks if there is a state with a specific name. It also checks for the value of the state (optional).  
If there is a state with the specific name and no value was specified in the condition, the condition holds true otherwise the condition is false.  
If there is a state with the specific name and the state value specified matches the states value the condition holds true otherwise the condition is false. 
 
Attributes: 
 
- name (required) 
The name attribute of the ```<stateIsSet>``` condition specifies the name of the state that is being checked for existence or for a matching value.  
 
- value (optional) 
The value attribute of the ```<stateIsSet>``` condition specifies the value of the state that is being checked.  
 
The following example demonstrates the ```<stateIsSet>``` condition:
```xml
<speechMacros>
     <command>
          <listenFor>Good morning computer</listenFor>
          <speak>Good morning</speak>
          <setState name = "aConversation" value ="morning" />
          <waitFor seconds = "5"/>
          <setState name ="aConversation" />
     </command>

     <command>
          <listenFor>Good night computer</listenFor>
          <speak>Good night</speak>
          <setState name = "aConversation" value ="night" />
          <waitFor seconds = "5"/>
          <setState name ="aConversation" />
     </command>

     <command>
          <stateIsSet name = "aConversation" value ="morning" />
          <listenFor>what are you drinking</listenFor>
          <speak>a glass of milk </speak>
          <setState name ="aConversation" />
     </command>

     <command>
          <stateIsSet name = "aConversation" value ="night" />
          <listenFor>what are you eating</listenFor>
          <speak>rice and beans</speak>
          <setState name ="aConversation" />
     </command>
</speechMacros>
```

 
The first ```<command>``` listens for "good morning computer", once it is recognized the engine speaks back "Good Morning". It then names a state "aConversation" with the value of "morning". After that it waits for five seconds and removes the named state.  
The second ```<command>``` does something similar, it listens for "good night computer" and once it is recognized the engine speaks back "Good Night". It then names a state "aConversation" with the value of "night". After that it waits for five second and removes the named state.  
The third ```<command>``` checks if the named state "aConversation" has the value of "morning". If true then and only then will it listen to "what are you drinking". 
The fourth ```<command>``` checks if the named state "aConversation" has the value of "night". If true then and only then will it listen to "what are you eating".  
The third and fourth ```<command>``` elements will never execute unless ```<stateIsSet>``` condition becomes true.

**```<condition>```**

The ```<condition>``` condition groups other conditions into logical expressions using the logical operators AND, OR, and NOT.  
 
**Attributes**
- name (optional) 
The name attribute of the ```<condition>``` condition names the condition so it can be referenced from other scripts/commands.  
 
- operator (required)  
The operator attribute of the ```<condition>``` condition specifies the logical operator that will be applied to the contained conditions.  

*Values*

AND  
All of the conditions contained must be true.  
 
The following example utilizes the AND operator for the ```<condition>``` condition. Both Notepad and Wordpad need to be running for the condition to be true:
```xml
<speechMacros>
     <command>
          <condition operator="AND">
               <appIsRunning processName = "NOTEPAD.EXE" />
               <appIsRunning processName = "WORDPAD.EXE" />
          </condition>
          <listenFor>Can I write</listenFor>
          <speak> Yes </speak>
     </command>
</speechMacros>
```
 
OR  
At least one of the conditions contained must be true.  
 
The following example utilizes an OR operator for the ```<condition>``` condition. If either Notepad or Wordpad is running the condition holds true:
```xml
<speechMacros>
     <command>
          <condition operator="OR">
               <appIsRunning processName = "NOTEPAD.EXE" />
               <appIsRunning processName = "WORDPAD.EXE" />
          </condition>
          <listenFor>Can I write</listenFor>
          <speak> Yes </speak>
     </command>
</speechMacros>
```
 
NOT  
All of the conditions contained must be false for the overall condition to be true.  
 
The following example utilizes the NOT operator for the ```<condition>``` condition. If both Notepad and Wordpad are not running the condition holds true:
```xml
<speechMacros>
     <command>
          <condition operator="OR">
               <appIsRunning processName = "NOTEPAD.EXE" />
               <appIsRunning processName = "WORDPAD.EXE" />
          </condition>
          <listenFor>Open a text editor</listenFor>
          <emulateRecognition> open Notepad </emulateRecognition>
     </command>
</speechMacros>
```

**```<scriptCondition>```**
 
The ```<scriptCondition>``` condition allows scripts to programmatically determine if the condition is met or not. The script is provided with the condition object model which the script can use to indicate wheter the condition is met or not.  

**Attributes**
 
- name (optional) 
The name attribute of the ```<scriptCondition>``` condition names the condition so it can be referenced from other scripts/commnads. 
 
- language (required) 
The language attribute of the ```<scriptCondition>``` condition indicates in what language the script is written in. 
*Values*:
     - "VBScript"
     - "JScript" 
 
Object Models available for ```<scriptCondition>```:  
Condition 
NamedStates 
Application 
Debug  
(link them latter to their respective page)  
 
The following example demonstrates how the ```<scriptCondition>``` is used to make a rule active only on Monday:
```xml
<speechMacros>
     <command>
          <scriptCondition language="JScript">
          Condition.Satisfied = ((new Date()).getDay() == 1);
          </scriptCondition>
          <listenFor>Open email</listenFor>
          <speak> Ok, opening email on monday </speak>
          <emulateRecognition>Open Microsoft Outlook</emulateRecognition>
     </command>
</speechMacros>
```

## Rule Generators
A rule generator defines what the computer should listen for to execute speech macros commands.

### Zero Rule Generators

There must be at least one rule generator inside each command. The entire command set will be rejected if any command contains no rule generators.

### One Rule Generator

There must be at least one rule generator inside each command.

### More than one Rule Generator

If there is more than one rule generator inside each command, the computer will listen for any of the phrase specified by the rule generators.  
 
In the following example the computer would listen for "I want to draw" or "I want to paint" to run Microsoft paint:
```xml
<speechMacros>
     <command>
          <listenFor>I want to draw</listenFor>
          <listenFor>I want to paint</listenFor>
          <run command="mspaint.exe" />
     </command>
</speechMacros>
```
 
### Global Rule Generators

Rule Generators can be children of the ```<speechMacros>``` node. These are Global Rule Generators and can be referenced by other rule generators from the command set.  
 
In the following example two commands reference a global rule generator that has a list of names:
```xml
<speechMacros>
     <command>
          <listenFor>Say hello to [person]</listenFor>
          <speak>Hello {[person]}</speak>
     </command>
 
     <command>
          <listenFor>Say goodbye to [person]</listenFor>
          <speak>Goodbye {[person]}</speak>
     </command>
    
     <rule name="person">
     <list>
          <p>Rob</p>
          <p>Alex</p>
          <p>Ana</p>
          <p>Travis</p>
          <p>Laura</p>
     </list>
     </rule>
</speechMacros>
```
 
Rule generators can have names (optional)

Rule generators can have names. Every Rule Generator name must be unique among all other Rule Generator and Command names.

List of Rule Generators

- listenFor
- listenForList
- rule 
- numbers
- fontNames
- fileNames
- ruleScript
- wmpMediaItems

**```<listenFor>```**
 
The ```<listenFor>``` rule generator creates a phrase for the speech recognizer to listen for.  
 
In the following example the ```<listenFor>``` rule generator creates the phrase "Play solitaire":
```xml
<listenFor>Play solitaire</listenFor>
<run command="solitaire.exe" />
```
 
**Attributes**

- name (optional)  
The name attribute of the ```<listenFor>``` rule generator specifies the name of the rule generator.
 
- Text between the ```<listenFor>``` tags:
     - If the text between the ```<listenFor>``` tags is plain text it will be converted to a SAPI 5 based rule. 
     - If the text between the ```<listenFor>``` tags is within brackets ("[" and "]") it is used as a rule reference.  
 
**Rule References:**

For more information about rule references visit the semantic properties section by clicking here.
 
- When the Rule name is equal to the Semantic Property name: 
If the name contained within brackets ("[" and "]") does not contain a period (".") the rule name and the semantic property name will be the same.  
For example if the text within the brackets is ```[number]``` both the rule reference name and the semantic property name will be *number*.  
 
- When the Rule name is part of the Semantic Property name:  
If the name contained within brackets ("[" and "]") does contain a period (".") the rule name will be the value after the period and the semantic property name will be the entire value.  
For example if the text within the brackets is ```[add.number]``` the rule reference name will be number and the semantic property name will be *add.number*.  
 
**Built-in Rules**  
In Windows Vista, the Speech User Experience keeps a set of rules to enhance command and control as well as text services. These rules are exported and available to the Speech Macro runtime on Windows Vista 
 
```textInDocument``` built-in rule  
The textInDocument built in rule refers to a word or a set of ordered words that exist in an active text document window.  
 
In the following example if Notepad is the foreground application any text contained in the document is exported as a rule so you can chose any string of ordered words and add quotes around them:
```xml
<listenFor>Put [textInDocument] in quotes</listenFor>
<emulateRecognition>Select {[textInDocument]}</emulateRecognition>
<waitFor seconds=".5" />
<sendKeys>^x"^v"</sendKeys>
```

```startableApplicationNames``` built-in rule  
The startableApplicationNames built-in rule refers to the names of the applications that can be started via the Start menu or desktop.  
 
The following example shows how to redefine a phrase ("How about bringing up ```[application]```") to start an application:
```xml
<listenFor>How about bringing up [startableApplicationNames]</listenFor>
<emulateRecognition>Start {[startableApplicationNames]}</emulateRecognition>
```

```itemOnScreen``` built-in rule  
The itemOnScreen built-in rule contains a list of all the named controls in the current application.  
If, for example, Notepad is the foreground application itemOnScreen would contain all of the "Menu Headings" (File, Edit, Format, etc) as well as "Close", "Minimize",etc 
 
The following example allows you to choose any control, for example if you have Notepad open you can say "Choose Format":
```xml
<listenFor>choose [itemOnScreen]</listenFor>
<emulateRecognition>click {[itemOnScreen]}</emulateRecognition>
```
 

 
```runningApplicationNames``` built-in rule  
The runningApplicationNames built-in rule contains a list of all of the applications currently running on the system.  
 
The following example copies selected text into an instance of Notepad already running on the system.
```xml
<listenFor>Copy that into [runningApplicationNames]</listenFor>
<sendKeys>^c</sendKeys> 
<emulateRecognition>switch to {[runningApplicationNames]}</emulateRecognition>
<waitFor seconds=".5" />
<sendKeys>^v</sendKeys>
```

**```<listenForList>```**
 
The ```<listenForList>``` rule generator generates a list of phrases for the speech recognizer to listen for.  

**Attributes**

- name  
The name attribute of the ```<listenFor>``` rule generator specifies the name of the rule.  
This attribute is optional when the ```<listenForList>``` rule generator is contained within a command.  
This attribute is required when the ```<listenForList>``` is a global rule generator.

- propname  
The propname attribute of the ```<listenFor>``` rule generator specifies the property that will be generated from the contained items.  
This attribute is optional if no contained ```<item>``` tags specify a property value.  
This attribute is required if any contained ```<item>``` tags specify a property value.

- useSubset  
The useSubset attribute of the ```<listenFor>``` rule generator indicates that an ordered subset of a phrase may be used to trigger the rule.  
Not all of the words in the phrase need to be spoken, but the words must be in the same order as they appear in the rule item.  
 
In the following example speaking "I want to draw in Paint", "I want to draw", "draw in paint" open the paint application (note, these words must be in the same order as they appear in the rule, "paint draw" would not open the application)
```xml
<listenForList name="openPaint" useSubset="true">
     <item> I want to draw in Paint </item>
</listenForList>
<speak>Ok</speak>
<emulateRecognition>open paint</emulateRecognition>
```

**Contained ```<item>``` tags**

The ```<listenForList>``` rule generator contains ```<item>``` tags and these define individual phrases that the recognizer should listen for.  
The propval attribute specifies the value of the semantic property that will be generated for this item if its recognized.  

The following example shows you how to use ```<listenForList>``` to send email to a specific person's email address using a global rule generator:
```xml
<command>
     <listenFor>Send email to [person]</listenFor>
     <setTextFeedback>Sending email to {[person]}</setTextFeedback>
     <run command="mailto:{[person.email]}" /> 
</command>
     <listenForList name="person" propname="email">
     <item propval="john@email.com">John</item>
     <item propval="travis@email.com">Travis</item>
     <item propval="kris@email.com">Kris</item>
</listenForList>
```

**```<rule>```**
 
The ```<rule>``` rule generator is used to wrap a SAPI 5 XML rule as defined by the SAPI SDK.  
 
**Attributes**

- name  
The name attribute of the ```<rule>``` rule generator specifies the name of the rule.  
This attribute is optional when the ```<rule>``` rule generator is contained within a command.  
This attribute is required when the ```<rule>``` is a global rule generator.  
 
The following example shows how to send an email using the ```<rule>``` rule generator:
```xml
<speechMacros>
     <command>
          <listenFor>Send email to [Contact]</listenFor>
          <run command="mailto:{[Contact.emailAddr]}" />
     </command>
     <rule name="Contact">
          <list propname="emailAddr">
               <p valstr="Lou@email.com">Lou</p>
               <p valstr="Oliver@email.com">Oliver</p>
               <p valstr="Laura@email.com">Laura</p>
          </list>
     </rule>
</speechMacros>
```

**```<numbers>```**
 
The ```<numbers>``` rule generator is used to generate phrases for a sequence of numbers.  
 
**Attributes**

- name  
The name attribute of the ```<numbers>``` rule generator specifies the name of the rule.  
This attribute is optional when the ```<rule>``` rule generator is contained within a command.  
This attribute is required when the ```<rule>``` is a global rule generator.

- propname  
The propname attribute of the ```<numbers>``` rule generator specifies the name of the property that will be generated for the spoken number. If propname is not specified it defaults to "number".

- start  
The start attribute of the ```<numbers>``` rule generator specifies the number to start with. If this attribute is not specified it defaults to 0 (zero).

- stop  
The stop attribute of the ```<numbers>``` rule generator specifies the number to stop with. If this attribute is not specified it defaults to 100 (one hundred).

> Note: Please choose a sensible range between the start and stop attribute values. Having a very large range may significantly slow down WSRMacros.

 
The following example shows how to scroll down on a browser by saying "Look down [ a number between 1 - 20 ] times":
```
<speechMacros>
     <command>
          <listenFor>Look down [times] times</listenFor>
          <emulateRecognition>scroll down {[times]}</emulateRecognition>
     </command>
     <numbers name="times" start="1" stop="20" />
</speechMacros>
```

**```<fontNames>```**
 
The ```<fontNames>``` rule generator is used to generate a set of phrases for all the fonts installed on the system.  
 
**Attributes**

- name  
The name attribute of the ```<fontNames>``` rule generator specifies the name of the rule.  
This attribute is optional when the ```<rule>``` rule generator is contained within a command.  
This attribute is required when the ```<rule>``` is a global rule generator.  
 
In the following example the ```<fontNames>``` global rule generator generates a list of all the installed fonts so they can be easily changed in Notepad:
```
<speechMacros>
     <command>
          <listenFor>Change the font to [fontName]</listenFor>
          <sendKeys>%o</sendKeys>
          <sendKeys>f</sendKeys>
          <waitFor seconds=".250" />
          <sendKeys>%f</sendKeys>
          <sendKeys>{[fontName]}</sendKeys>
          <waitFor seconds=".250" />
          <sendKeys>{ENTER}</sendKeys>
     </command>
     <fontNames name="fontName" />
</speechMacros>
```

**```<fileNames>```**
 
The ```<fileNames>``` rule generator is used to generate a set of phrases for all the files in a specified directory.  
(Hidden and/or system files will not be included)  
 
**Attributes**

- name  
The name attribute of the ```<fileNames>``` rule generator specifies the name of the rule.  
This attribute is optional when the ```<fileNames>``` rule generator is contained within a command.  
This attribute is required when the ```<fileNames>``` is a global rule generator.  

- propname (optional)  
The propname attribute of the ```<fileNames>``` rule generator specifies the fully qualified name for the file.

- directory (required)  
The directory attribute of the ```<fileNames>``` rule generator specifies the name of the directory that should be inspected for filenames. If the directory does not exist the rule generator will not generate any phrases.  
Note: Ensure that the directory specified in this attribute is present in your computer. If the directory specified by this attribute does not exist in your computer, the Speech Macro will fail to load.

- includeSubdirectories (optional)  
The includeSubdirectories attribute of the ```<fileNames>``` rule generator specifies wheter or not subdirectories should be inspected.

- useSubset (optional)  
The useSubset attribute of the ```<fileNames>``` rule generator indicates that an ordered subset of a phrase may be used to trigger the rule.  
Not all of the words in the phrase need to be spoken, but the words must be in the same order as they appear in the rule item.  
 
The following example allows the user to open any document in the folder "C:\publicFiles" by saying "Open" followed by the name of any file inside the folder:
```xml
<speechMacros>
     <command>
          <listenFor>Open [publicFiles]</listenFor>
          <setTextFeedback>Opening {[publicFiles.fileName]}</setTextFeedback>

**Attributes**

- name  
The name attribute of the ```<wmpMediaItems>``` rule generator specifies the name of the rule.  
This attribute is optional when the ```<wmpMediaItems>``` rule generator is contained within a command.  
This attribute is required when the ```<wmpMediaItems>``` is a global rule generator.

- propname  
The propname attribute of the ```<wmpMediaItems>``` rule generator specifies the name of the property that will be generated from the contained items.

- propvalue  
The propvalue attribute of the ```<wmpMediaItems>``` rule generator contain any valid WMP attribute value enclosed in brackets.  
Valid values are defined in the WMP SDK attribute reference

- attrname  
The attrname attribute of the ```<wmpMediaItems>``` rule generator specifies the attribute name that will be used to play music in Windows Media Player.  
Valid values are defined in the WMP SDK attribute reference

- attrvalue (optional)  
The attrvalue attribute of the ```<wmpMediaItems>``` rule generator specifies the attribute value that will be used t o filter the set of music items in the Windows Media Player by their attrname.

- listenFor (optional)  
The listenFor attribute of the ```<wmpMediaItems>``` rule generator specifies what should be listened for; it defaults to name.

- useSubset (optional)  
The useSubset attribute of the ```<wmpMediaItems>``` rule generator indicates that an ordered subset of a phrase may be used to trigger the rule.  
Not all of the words in the phrase need to be spoken, but the words must be in the same order as they appear in the rule item.  
 
In the following example ```<wmpMediaItems>``` rule generator is used to generate a rule containing all the known artists in the Windows Media Player Library:
```xml
<speechMacros>
     <command>
          <listenFor>Play ?the ?artist [Artists]</listenFor>
          <wmpMediaPlay attrname="WM/AlbumArtist" attrvalue="{[Artist]}" />
     </command>
     <wmpMediaItems name="Artists" propname="Artist" attrname="WM/AlbumArtist" useSubset="false" />
</speechMacros>
```

## Executors
 
An executor specifies the action a computer should take once a spoken phrase matches a rule generator.

### Zero Executors

It is not valid for a ```<command>``` to have zero executors.

### One Executor

There must be at least one executor inside a ```<command>```. Once a spoken command matches a phrase from a rule generator the executor executes.

### More than One Executor

If multiple executors are within a ```<command>``` they will execute in order, synchronously, once a spoken command matches a phrase from a rule generator.

**```<sendKeys>```**

The ```<sendKeys>``` executor sends keyboard keys to the application running in the foreground.  The following example allows you to copy a string of text "CTRL+C" and pastes it "CTRL+V" into WordPad:
```
<command>
    <listenFor>Copy that into wordpad</listenFor>
    <sendKeys>^c</sendKeys>
    <run command="wordpad.exe" />
    <waitFor seconds="1.0" />
    <sendKeys>^v</sendKeys>
</command>
```
 
**Attributes**

- times (optional)  
The times attribute of the ```<sendKeys>``` executor specifies the number of times the keys should be sent to the application. It defaults to 1 and maximum is 20.  

**Text between ```<sendKeys>``` executor**   
The text contained within ```<sendKeys>``` executor specify the keys to send to the foreground application. [Click](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.sendkeys.aspx) for a list of the standard definition of keys per the Windows Platform. New Keys for WSR Macros:

Key text | Key definition
--- | ---
{WIN} | Windows Key
{LWIN} | Left Windows Key
{RWIN} | Right Windows Key
{MENU} | Menu Key
{CTRL} | Control Key
{LCTRL} | Left Control Key
{RCTRL} | Right Control Key
{CAPSLOCK+} | Puts CAPSLOCK in the "ON" state
{CAPSLOCK-} | Puts CAPSLOCK in the "OFF" state
{NUMLOCK+} | Puts NUMLOCK in the "ON" state
{NUMLOCK-} | Puts NUMLOCK in the "OFF" state
{SCROLLLOCK+} | Puts SCROLLLOCK in the "ON" state
{SCROLLLOCK-} | Puts SCROLLLOCK in the "OFF" state
{NUM0} - {NUM9} | Number pad 0 - Number pad 9
{NUM*} | Number pad *
{NUM/} | Number pad /
{NUM+} | Number pad +
{NUM-} | Number pad -
{NUM~} | Number pad ENTER
{n WAIT} | Wait for n milliseconds before sending next key
 
**Modifiers**

In addition to the standard modifiers "+" (Shift) "%" (ALT) and "^" (Control) any key can be used as a modifier key by enclosing it in curly {} braces.  
For example:  
{LALT}g - hold and releases Left ALT then hold and release the "g" key.  
LALTg - presses and holds Left ALT, presses "g" then it releases Left ALT and "g" keys.  
 
Any key may be used this way. {a} presses and releases the "a" key.

**Virtual Keys**

To send a virtual key use ```{VK n}``` where the n is the scancode in decimal of the key to send. To use a hex value prefix t he number with a "#" sign. 
For example:  
To send VK_BROWSER_HOME - ```{VK 172}``` or ```{VK #AC}```

**Unicode Characters**

To send a Unicode character use ```{U+nnnn}``` where nnnn is a four digit hex number identifying the Unicode character to send.  
For example:  
Ï´ (theta) - ```{U+03F4}```

**Invalid Key Combinations**

The following list include the keys or key combinations that are not allowed due to the limitations of the ```<sendKeys>``` API:  
- WIN+L - Log off Windows.  
- PRTSCR - Print Screen. Note: To use Print Screen you can emulate the phrase "Print Screen". Please refer to the ```<emulateRecognition>``` executor.  
- CTRL+WIN+F- Find Computer. Note: In WSR Macros any combination that includes CTRL+WIN results in turning the Speech Recognition off. 
- CTRL+WIN+TAB-Move focus from Start, to the Quick Launch toolbar, to the System tray. Note: In WSR Macros any combination that includes CTRL+WIN results in turning the Speech Recognition off.

 
> IMPORTANT: The keys between double braces -{{key}}- are important and are called modifiers. As a rule, they will always be higher in precedence than all the other keys. The keys enclosed in single braces -{key}- are called non-modifiers. The rest of the keys are considered normal keys (letters or numbers) and don't need braces.

The keys that are mainly used for double or single braces are Ctrl, Alt, Shift, F1 to F9 , TAB, ESC etc. Normal keys such as a letters or numbers, won't have any set of braces and they will be last in the sequence. A modifier is a key that is pressed, awaits for another key to be pressed and then they are both released. This is used when using combinations such as {{CTRL}} C (copy), {{CTRL}} V (paste), {{CTRL}}{{SHIFT}}{ESC}. The keys that are enclosed in single braces are those that aren't apart of simple numbers and letters and are also not pressed and kept pressed awaiting for another key.

It is important to keep the braces precedence to have a macro working properly. The order is {{all modifiers}} {all non-modifiers} normal keys . To better understand this, it is correct to use {{CTRL}}{{SHIFT}}{ESC} (notice that there is no modifier after the non-modifier), but incorrect to use {ESC}{{CTRL}}{{SHIFT}} or {{CTRL}}{ESC}{{SHIFT}}. The modifiers -{{keys}}- must always be put first.

When creating this type of macros be careful to the numbers of braces used for modifiers and non-modifiers keys and the order in which you write them. If there is one little mistake, the macros won't function correctly and you will get an error message similar to the one below.

**```<insertText>```**
 
The ```<insertText>``` executor inserts text into the foreground application.  
 
â€¢ Text between ```<insertText>``` executor: 
The text contained within the ```<insertText>``` executor specifies what text to send to the foreground application.

Text between ```<emulateRecognition>``` executor: 
The text contained within the ```<emulateRecognition>``` executor specifies the text of voice command to be emulated by the speech recognition engine.

> Note: Emulate recognition does not validate the correction of the text between the tags therefore invalid characterers, extra white spaces and mispelled words may corrupt its execution and it may fail silently.

 
In the following example allows to copy the screen into paint:
```xml
<command>
    <listenFor>Copy the screen into paint</listenFor>
    <emulateRecognition>Press print screen</emulateRecognition>
    <run command="mspaint.exe" />

**```<mouse>```**
 
The ```<mouse>``` executor manipulates the mouse pointer.  
 
**Attributes**
- button (optional)  
The button attribute of the ```<mouse>``` executor specifies which button to press. Available values are "left","right", and "middle"; it defaults to "left".
- command(required)  
The command attribute of the ```<mouse>``` executor specifies what action the mouse should perform. Values are "click", "dblclick" and "scroll".
- modifierKeys(optional)  
The modifierKeys attribute of the ```<mouse>``` executor allows for using CTRL (^), ALT (%), and SHIFT (+) keys while manipulating the mouse pointer.
- position (optional)  
The position attribute of the ```<mouse>``` executor indicates horizontal (x) and vertical (y) coordinates of where to locate the mouse cursor.
- positionStyle (optional)  
The positionStyle of the ```<mouse>``` executor indicates the position style of the mouse pointer. If assigned to "absolute" the x and y coordinates are mapped to the computer's screen resolution.  
If assigned to "virtual" the coordinates are mapped to the "virtual" system in which the top left corner coordinates are 0,0; the middle of the screen coordinates are 32768,32768 and bottom right corner coordinates are 65536,65536. It defaults to "absolute".  
- scrollAmount (optional)  
The scrollAmount of the ```<mouse>``` executor indicates the scroll increment.
- scrollDirection (optional)  
The scrollDirection of the ```<mouse>``` executor indicates the scrolling direction. Values are "up" or "down".

The following example moves the mouse cursor to the bottom right corner and double clicks on the date:
```xml
<command>
    <listenFor>Click on today's date</listenFor>
    <mouse button="left" command="dblclick" position="65536,65536" positionStyle="virtual" />
</command>
```

**```<disambiguate>```**

The ```<disambiguate>``` executor is used to disambiguate potentially ambigous properties or text from a recognition result.  
If the item is ambigous a dialog box will be displayed to the user allowing him/her to choose the specific item from the list.  
 
**Attributes**
- propname (required)  
The propname attribute of the ```<disambiguate>``` executor specifies the name of the property that will be disambiguated.  
- timeout (optional)  
The timeout attribute of the ```<disambiguate>``` executor specifies how long, in seconds, should the executor wait for an answer. If the user do not respond in the given timeout the command is canceled. The default is INFINITE.  
- title (optional)  
The title attribute of the ```<disambiguate>``` executor specifies the title of the dialog box.  
- prompt  
The prompt attribute of the ```<disambiguate>``` executor specifies the text prompted to the user in the dialog box.  

The following example allows plays music by artist name and allows for disambiguation of similar artists names:
```xml
<speechMacros>
    <command>
        <listenFor>Play ?the ?artist [Artists]</listenFor>
        <disambiguate title="Which artist do you want to play?" prompt="Choose an Artist" timeout="25" propname="Artist" />
        <wmpMediaControl command="pause" />
        <speak>Playing Artist {[Artist]}</speak>
        <wmpMediaPlay attrname="WM/AlbumArtist" attrvalue="{[Artist]}" />
    </command>
    <wmpMediaItems name="Artists" propname="Artist" attrname="WM/AlbumArtist" useSubset="true" />
</speechMacros>
```

## Semantic Properties
 
Semantic properties allows you to use executors in a generic form.  
 
To understand semantic properties let us consider the following example:  
Suppose you wanted to create a command that could send email to a set of people by saying things like "send email to John" or "send email to Kris". It would be nice to be able to specify the email address of each person. 
 
The email address would be considered as a semantic property: It is not something the user said but it is something associated to what the user said.

A single semantic property
The following script enables sending an email to a single person:
```xml
<speechMacros>
    <command>
        <listenFor>Send email to [person]</listenFor>
        <setTextFeedback>Sending email to {[person]}</setTextFeedback>
        <run command="mailto:{[person.email]}" /> 
    </command>

    <rule name="person">
        <list propname="email">
            <p valstr="john@email.com">John</p>
            <p valstr="kris@email.com">Kris</p>
            <p valstr="travis@email.com">Travis</p>
        </list>
    </rule>
</speechMacros>
```

Let us examine the above script:
```xml 
<listenFor>Send email to [person]</listenFor>
```
 
Inside the text area of the ```<listenFor>``` executor, "person" is both a rule name and a semantic property name. A rule name reference means that the list of people will be defined inside this command set using a rule generator named "person". A semantic property means that if any executor asks for a semantic property by name, and the name is "person", it should return the text that was spoken. For example if the user said "send email to John" the semantic property named "person" would have the value "John".
```xml
<setTextFeedback> Sending email to {[person]} </setTextFeedback>
```
 
Inside the text area of the ```<setTextFeedback>``` executor, "person" is referenced again and this time it is inside "{[ ]}" brackets. These double brackets tell the executor to look for the value of the semantic property named "person". Since the semantic value of "person" is "John" the Speech Recognition UI will display "Sending email to John".
```xml
<run command="mailto:{[person.email]}">
``` 
 
You can also associate other values with the phrases recognized. In this line of code "person.email" inside "{[ ]}" brackets tell the executor to look up the semantic property named "person.email" and substitute that value inside the ```<run>``` executor. This value is contained in the rule generator named "person":
```xml
<rule name="person">
     <list propname="email">
        <p valstr="john@email.com">John</p>
        <p valstr="kris@email.com">Kris</p>
        <p valstr="travis@email.com">Travis</p>
     </list>
</rule>
```

This rule named "person" contains the semantic property "email". For "John" the semantic property "person.email" returns the value "John@email.com". Thus, the semantic property person.email inside the ```<run>``` executor will be substituted with "mailto:John@email.com".  

Multiple Semantic Properties
Lets change the above script so we can CC the email to another person:
```xml
<speechMacros>
    <command>
        <listenFor>Send email to [to.person] and CC [cc.person] </listenFor>
        <setTextFeedback> Sending email to {[to.person]} and CCing {[cc.person]} </setTextFeedback>
        <run command="mailto:{[to.person.email]}?cc={[cc.person.email]}" /> 
    </command>

    <rule name="person">
        <list propname="email">
            <p valstr="john@email.com">John</p>
            <p valstr="kris@email.com">Kris</p>
            <p valstr="travis@email.com">Travis</p>
        </list>
    </rule>
</speechMacros>
```

The key difference in this example is that it shows you how to change the name of the semantic property being used from being the same as the rule name
```xml
<listenFor> Send email to [to.person] and CC [cc.person] </listenFor>
```
 
Here the semantic property "to.person" will contain the value the user said ("John","Kris",etc) and the rule name "person".
```xml
<setTextFeedback> Sending email to {[to.person]} and CCing {[cc.person]} </setTextFeedback>
```
 
Similarly, the { } brackets tell the ```<setTextFeedback>``` executor to substitute the semantic property value. Therefore if the user said "Send email to John and CC Kris" the Speech Recognition UI will display "Sending email to John and CCing Kris".
```xml
<run command="mailto:{[to.person.email]}?cc={[cc.person.email]}" />
```
 
Since to.person also contains the rule named "person", the semantic value of "to.person.email" will be extracted from the rule named "person". For this example the ```<run>``` executor will be replaced with "mailto:john@email.com?cc=kris@email.com".

Using the Same Rule and the Same Property name multiple times.
A more complicated example involves multiple semantic properties with the same property name for example ```person1[,person2[,person3]]```. Let's edit the email script so it allows the user to send an email for up to three different people:
```xml
<speechMacros>
    <command>
        <rule>
        <p>Send email to</p>
        <p min="1" max="3"> <ruleref name="person" propname="person"/>
            <o>and</o> </p> 
        </rule>
        <setTextFeedback> Sending email to {[foreach:{[person]};]} </setTextFeedback>
        <run command="mailto:{[foreach:{[person.email]};]}" /> 
    </command>

    <rule name="person">
        <list propname="email">
            <p valstr="john@email.com">John</p>
            <p valstr="kris@email.com">Kris</p>
            <p valstr="travis@email.com">Travis</p>
        </list>
    </rule>
</speechMacros>
```

The three major changes are:  
- We are using the ```<rule>``` rule generator instead of the ```<listenFor>``` rule generator.  
- We changed the ```<sendTextFeedback>``` executor.  
- We changed the ```<run>``` executor.  
 
Let's take a look at each change:
```xml
<rule>
     <p>Send email to</p>
     <p min="1" max="3"> <ruleref name="person" propname="person"/>
          <o>and</o>
     </p>
</rule>
```

The first ```<p>``` tag of the ```<rule>``` rule generator tells the computer to listen for the phrase "Send email to". The second ```<p>``` tag states that the ```<ruleref>``` tag must be used at least one (min="1") and at most three times (max="3"). The ```<ruleref>``` tag tells the computer to reference the rule named "person" and to use a semantic property of the same name. The last tag ```<o>``` says that "and" is optional after a person's name. This rule generator allows the user to say "Send email to John", "Send email to John and Travis", "Send email to John, Travis and Kris", and "Send email to John and Travis and Kris".
```xml
<setTextFeedback> Sending email to {[foreach:{[person]};]} </setTextFeedback>
```
 
For the ```<setTextFeedback>``` executor we have concatenated each semantic property by using the foreach statement. The Speech Recognition UI will display each name separated by a semicolon; so if we said "Send email to John, Travis and Kris" the UI will display "Sending email to John; Travis; Kris;".
```xml
<run command="mailto:{[foreach:{[person.email]};]}" />
```
 
Similarly to ```<setTextFeedback>```, the ```<run>``` executor will replace each vaule of person.email using the foreach statment with the proper semantic value. So for "Send email to John, Travis and Kris" the "mailto" command will contain "John@email.com;Travis@email.com;Kris@email.com;"  

Using different Rules and different Property names.
You can also use different rules that have different semantic properties. Lets edit the email script so we can send an email with a priority property:
```xml
<speechMacros>
    <command>
        <listenFor>Send [priority] email to [person] </listenFor>
        <setTextFeedback> Sending {[priority]} email to {[person]} </setTextFeedback>
        <run command="mailto:{[person.email]}" />
        <waitFor seconds="1" />
        <sendKeys>{[priority.keysToSend]}</sendKeys> 
    </command>

    <rule name="person">
        <list propname="email">
            <p valstr="john@email.com">John</p>
            <p valstr="kris@email.com">Kris</p>
            <p valstr="travis@email.com">Travis</p>
        </list>
    </rule>
    <rule name="priority">
        <o>
            <list propname="keysToSend">
                <p valstr="%ph{enter}">high priority</p>
                <p valstr="%pl{enter}">low priority</p>
                <p valstr=" ">normal priority</p>
            </list>
        </o>
    </rule>
</speechMacros>
``` 

Let us examin these new changes:
```xml
<listenFor>Send [priority] email to [person] </listenFor>
```
 
In this script we have added a new rule reference named "priority".
```xml
<waitFor seconds="1" />
<sendKeys>{[priority.keysToSend]}</sendKeys>
```

We have added two new executors the ```<waitFor>``` executor will wait for one second after executing the ```<run>``` executor. The ```<sendKeys>``` will replace the value in "priority.keysToSend" with its respective semantic value.
```xml
<rule name="priority">
    <o>
        <list propname="keysToSend">
            <p valstr="%ph{enter}">high priority</p>
            <p valstr="%pl{enter}">low priority</p>
            <p valstr="">normal priority</p>
        </list>
    </o>
</rule>
```

The new ```<rule>``` rule generator defines a new rule named "priority" and it generates a semantic property named "keysToSend".  
 
With this scrip the user is allow to say "Send email to John" and everything works as before however the user can add a priority to the email message. For example if the user says "send high priority email to John" the executor ```<run>``` will contain "mailto:john@email.com" then the script will wait for one second and set the importance to High in Outlook by sending the keys "ALT-P" followed by an "H" and "Enter" which is defined by %ph{enter} (for more information about the ```<sendKeys>``` executor visit the executors section of the Windows Speech Recognition Macros wiki).

> Note. Priority Shortcuts may not be the same for every email client.

### RuleItem Object
The RuleItem object represents a spoken phrase and their property value within a rule.

**Methods**

**```Clone ```**
The Clone method creates a copy of the RuleItem object.  
Parameters:None.  
Return Value:A RuleItem object that is a copy of the original.

**Properties**

**```Phrase (read/write) ```**
Type: BSTR 
The Phrase property of a RuleItem object is a string that contains the text the recognizer should listen for.  
Example:  
myRuleItem.Phrase = "John Smith"; 
In this example, the recognizer listens for "John Smith". 
 
**```Property (read/write) ```**
Type:BSTR 
The Property property of the RuleItem object is the semantic property associated with the item.  
Example:  
myRuleItem.Phrase = "John Smith"; 
myRuleItem.Property = "johnsmith@email.com"; 
In this example, the recognizer listens for "John Smith" and sets the semantic property of the rule to "johnsmith@email.com".  
 
**```UseSubsets (read/write) ```**
Type:BOOL  
The UseSubsets property of the RuleItem object indicates if the recognizer should accept an ordered subset of the words contained in the Phrase property rather than the entire set of words.  
Example:  
```js
myRuleItem.Phrase = "John Austin Smith Junior";  
myRuleItem.Property = "johnsmith@email.com";  
myRuleItem.UseSubsets = true;  
```
In this example, setting UseSubsets to true allows the recognizer to listen for "John Austin", "Austin Junior", "John Smith" to match this rule item. If UseSubsets property were set to false only "John Austin Smith Junior" would be recognized to match the RuleItem.

 

### RuleItemCollection Object

### Rule object
The Rule object creates or modifies rules within a Rule Generator. Most commonly this object is used by ```<ruleScript>``` scripts to generate rules on the fly.

**Methods**

**```Commit ```**
The Commit method causes the rule to be generated and inserted into the recognizer. The call to Commit() is optional within a ```<ruleScript>``` script.

Setting the XML directly using this property causes the Items of the Rule object to be emptied, and no manipulation of the rule can be done through the Items object.  
If the InnerXML property has not been explicitly set, this property returns the SAPI XML generated by the Items collection as it is sent to the recognizer.   
Parameters: None.  
Return Value: BSTR - The SAPI XML representing this Rule object. 
 
**```RuleName (read only) ```**
The RuleName property returns the name of the Rule. This is a read-only property. The RuleName for ```<ruleScript>``` Rule Generators is determined by the "name=" attribute of the ```<ruleScript>``` tag.

Return Value: BSTR-The name of the rule.  
 
**```PropName (read only) ```**
The PropName property returns the name of the semantic property associated with items of the Rule object. The PropName for ```<ruleScript>``` Rule Generators is determined by the "propname=" attribute of the ```<ruleScript>``` tag.  
Parameters: None  
Return Value: BSTR-The name of the semantic properties associated with this rule.
